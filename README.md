- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that requires *more* than **me** to finish, which happens to be **ALOT** of *things*. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with *issues* I get myself into that are quite *above* my pay grade, which also happens to be **ALOT** of *things*.

- âš¡ Fun fact: If you scream continuously for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would produce enough energy to heat up a cup of coffee. It seems like 3 dollars for starbucks doesn't seem so bad after all.
